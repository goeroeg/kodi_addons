## plugin.mediaklikk.hu

This is a [KODI](https://kodi.tv/) addon for watching live TV streams from the hungarian site [Mediaklikk.hu](https://www.mediaklikk.hu/)

Live streams are supported and also the mediastore (_Médiatár_) and the filmstore (_Filmtár_). Radio audio streams not yet supported.

**It is in a very early stage, use it at your own risk.**

### Deployment to KODI

Download and zip the folder `plugin.video.mediaklikk`, copy the zip-file to a location you can reach from KODI and select "*Install from zip*" ("*unknown sources*" have to be enabled in the settings)

>If you are not sure what is meant by the above, then this addon is probably not yet for you.

Anyway, any comments are welcome!
